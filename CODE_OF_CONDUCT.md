# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.
- Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes.
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported through GitHub Security Advisories or by opening a moderation issue
